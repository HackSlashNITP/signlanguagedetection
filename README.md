✨The key points making this one exceptional are that the deep CNN model has been trained on over 500 real-time high-quality images captured from the webcam and is capable to detect hand signs from 0-9 (which can easily be extended to include A-Z). 

✨The robustness of this solution lies in the fact that its training has been done against different environment weights and runs on Web GL without any issues of platform resources or downtime.
